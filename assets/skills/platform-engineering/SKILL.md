# Platform Engineering

Core methodology and reference library for platform engineering work. This skill does not execute operations itself — it provides the frameworks, patterns, and reference material that a platform-engineer profile loads on demand.

## When to Load

Load this skill when the task involves:

| Trigger | What's Needed |
|---------|---------------|
| Design a CI/CD pipeline | Pipeline structure, GitOps sync strategies, release automation |
| Infrastructure as code plan | Terraform/OpenTofu module patterns, state management, Pulumi/Ansible patterns |
| Container orchestration design | K8s pod lifecycle, Helm chart conventions, Kustomize overlays, Docker Compose |
| Service networking / mesh | Traefik/nginx/Caddy config, Tailscale/Headscale ACL, WireGuard, service mesh |
| Observability strategy | Prometheus rules, Grafana dashboards-as-code, Loki logging, tracing |
| Secret management design | Vault, SOPS, External Secrets Operator patterns |
| Cloud architecture assessment | Multi-cloud patterns, provider foundations, cost governance |
| Deployment pipeline review | End-to-end delivery pipeline audit, release engineering patterns |

## Loading Order

```
skill_view('platform-engineering')          # This — methodology index
skill_view('artifact-pyramids')              # Output contract
skill_view('docker-management')              # Container lifecycle (if needed)
skill_view('traefik')                        # Reverse proxy (if needed)
skill_view('tailscale')                      # Mesh networking (if needed)
skill_view('implementation-planning')        # Work breakdown (if needed)
```

Then load domain-specific references from this skill:

```
skill_view('platform-engineering', file_path='references/ci-cd-pipelines.md')
skill_view('platform-engineering', file_path='references/infrastructure-as-code.md')
# ... etc per domain
```

## Output Contract

The profile using this skill produces artifact pyramids. The response to any caller is the absolute path to `00-index.md`. See `artifact-pyramids` skill for the specification.

## Design Principles

1. **The platform is a product.** Internal developers are your customers. Their productivity, satisfaction, and cognitive load are the primary metrics.
2. **Golden paths, not golden cages.** Provide paved roads for common workflows but allow escape hatches. Make the right thing easy, not the wrong thing impossible.
3. **Reduce cognitive load.** Abstract infrastructure complexity. Developers should not need to understand Kubernetes internals or Terraform state management to deploy their service.
4. **Everything as code.** Infrastructure, configuration, pipelines, and policies are version-controlled, reviewed, and reproducible. Git is the single source of truth.
5. **Self-service over tickets.** Every manual handoff between teams is a bottleneck. If a developer needs another team to deploy, the platform is incomplete.
6. **Automation is the default.** If a process can be automated, it must be. Manual operations are toil — tax on the organization.
7. **Observability is infrastructure.** Logs, metrics, traces, and dashboards are platform contract, not optional extras. Every service gets them by default.
8. **Security is built in, not bolted on.** Supply chain security, secret management, vulnerability scanning, and policy enforcement are platform responsibilities.
9. **API-first design.** Everything the platform does should be accessible via API — enabling automation, self-service portals, and CLI tools.
